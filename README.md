# 0h-n0-game
A web game imitating the game "Oh no" (stylized "0h n0") by Q42, originally created by Martin Kool (www.0hn0.com). The game takes an integer N and creates an N by N 0h n0 puzzle. A puzzle board is defined as an N by N board containing red, blue, or empty cells. Blue cells contain a number indicating the number of other blue cells which are visible from the current blue cell in the solution. A blue cell is visible from an origin blue cell if it lies on the same row or column as the origin blue cell, and there are no red cells that lie between it and the origin blue cell. A solution is a board where all cells are either red or blue, and a puzzle board is solvable if it has exactly one solution.
